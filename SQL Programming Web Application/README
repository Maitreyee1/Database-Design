This SQL programming project involves the creation of a database host application that interfaces with a backend SQL database implementing a Contact List application. 
The system is developed using PHP 7.2 for GUI and MySQL as backend database. PHP uses mysqli functionality to connect PHP page with the backend database using ODBC constructs.

if localhost doesn't not work; try adding 127.0.0.1 at the same place.
